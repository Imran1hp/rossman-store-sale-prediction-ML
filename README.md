🏪 Rossmann Store Sales Prediction
📖 Overview

This project aims to predict the daily/weekly sales of Rossmann stores across various locations using historical sales data.
It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling to forecast future sales 📈.

⚙️ Project Workflow

🧹 Data Preprocessing — Handle missing values, convert date fields, and encode categorical variables.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Visualize trends, correlations, and store-level performance.

🧠 Model Building — Train regression models (like Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict sales.

📊 Evaluation — Use metrics such as RMSE or MAE to evaluate model performance.

💡 Prediction — Generate predictions for unseen test data and analyze performance.
